    Any use of WO Accelerator other than as specifically authorized in this Agreement, without our prior written

    <h3>License You Grant to Us Over User Content</h3>

    <strong> Permission to Use User Content.</strong> WO Accelerator allows you to upload your own script, synopsis,
    or writing sample to apply to the program (a “Writing”). By uploading a Writing through our Site, you grant us a
    license to use it to review and evaluate your Writing to determine program acceptance into WO Accelerator.
    Specifically (and apologies for the legalese), you grant WO Accelerator a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
    irrevocable, sub-licensable through multiple levels of sublicensees, perpetual license to use, edit, digitize,
    modify, reproduce, distribute, and store the Writing to provide our service and to operate WO Accelerator. If you
    are accepted into the WOAccelerator program, you will enter into a separate licensing agreement and we may
    feature the Writing on our Site and in related marketing and promotional materials (both digital and print).
    <br>
    In addition to Writings, when you submit, post, or otherwise engage in direct communications with WO Accelerator
    (through the use of our Site, via a telephone call with a member of our team, via email, messaging platform, or
    otherwise) (i.e., send a “Communication”) you also grant us a license to modify, use, adapt, copy, and publish
    the Communication. You agree that this license includes the right for WO Accelerator to use the Communication for
    promotional purposes and to improve the Site.
    <br>
    <strong>Responsibility for User Content.</strong> You understand that you are solely responsible for any Writing
    or Communication sent to WO Accelerator. By uploading a Writing or sending a Communication to WO Accelerator, you
    represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to the Writing and that you’re not infringing or
    violating any third party’s rights by uploading the Writing, including, but not limited to, privacy rights,
    publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights. You agree that the Writing or
    Communication provided to WO Accelerator is non-confidential and that WO Accelerator has the right to unrestricted
    use for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.
    <br>
    <strong>Disclosure of Writing is Not Confidential.</strong> By uploading a Writing to WO Accelerator, you agree
    that WO Accelerator may discuss your Writing with its employees and authorized agents to evaluate the Writing and
    your acceptance into WO Accelerator programs. By submitting a Writing or applying to a WO Accelerator program, you
    acknowledge and agree that you are not creating a confidential relationship between you and WO Accelerator.
    <br>
    <strong>Submission of Writing is Not Returned.</strong> If you submit a Writing to WO Accelerator, you
    acknowledge and agree that WO Accelerator is not obligated to return the Writing to you. You should keep a copy
    of any Writing submitted. You further acknowledge and agree that WO Accelerator is not agreeing to provide you
    with any compensation for your Writing, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.

    <h3>Governing Law</h3>

    No matter where you’re located, the laws of the State of Delaware will govern these Terms and the parties’
    relationship as if you signed these Terms in Delaware, without regard to Delaware state’s conflicts of law
    rules. If any provisions of these Terms are inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be
    superseded or modified only to the extent such provisions are inconsistent. The parties agree to submit to the
    federal or state courts in Delaware County, Delaware for exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute arising out of or
    related to your use of WO Accelerator or your breach of these Terms. You waive any objection based on lack of
    personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue, or forum non conveniens in any such action.
    <br>
    <h3>Note to International Users</h3>

    Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that
    differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, which is governed
    by US law, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.

    will still continue.
    <br>
    <h3>No Waiver</h3>
    Our failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall not
    operate as a waiver; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any
    other or further exercise thereof.
    <br>
    <h3>Severability</h3>
    If it turns out that any part of this Agreement is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term
    will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or
    elimination of the term will not affect any other terms.
    <br>
    <h3>Arbitration & Waiver of Class Action</h3>

    The parties agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from this Agreement or your use of the Site on an individual
    basis. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY EXPRESSLY
    WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. The parties agree that: (i) any arbitration will occur in Delaware, Delaware; and (ii) the
    arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of American
    Arbitration Association for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, in the English language, and with limited
    discovery. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide
    for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. Other than class procedures and
    remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available
    to a court or other tribunal. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE
    ENTITLED TO COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. THE ARBITRAL DECISION MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT. WHETHER THE DISPUTE
    IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, THE PARTIES WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY A CLASS ACTION, CLASS
    ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
    <br>

    <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
    We shall not be held liable for any delays, failure in performance, or interruption of service which result
    directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to:
    any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorism, civil
    disturbance, pandemic, epidmic, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or
    Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe, or any
    other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
    any remaining provisions.
    <br>
    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    You agree that we may assign any of our rights and/or transfer, sub-contract, or delegate any of our obligations
    under these Terms. Your agreement to these Terms is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to any
    third party.
    <br>
    <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>

    any and all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any
    prior versions of this Agreement) and every nature between us. Except as provided for above, any modification to

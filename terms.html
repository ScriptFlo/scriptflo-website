    apply to you.

    <strong>Don’t Try To Harm Our System.</strong> You agree not to distribute any virus or other harmful computer
    code through ScriptFlo. You also agree to not take any action that may impose an unreasonable or
    disproportionately large load on our or any of our third party providers’ infrastructure.

    <strong>Don’t Attempt to Circumvent Our Security. </strong>You agree not to bypass, circumvent, or attempt to

    Any use of ScriptFlo other than as specifically authorized in this Agreement, without our prior written
    permission, is strictly prohibited and will terminate your license to use ScriptFlo.

    <h3>License You Grant to Us Over User Content</h3>

    <strong> Permission to Use User Content.</strong> ScriptFlo allows you to upload your own script, synopsis,
    or writing sample to apply to the program (a “Writing”). By uploading a Writing through our Site, you grant us a
    license to use it to review and evaluate your Writing to determine program acceptance into ScriptFlo.
    Specifically (and apologies for the legalese), you grant ScriptFlo a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
    irrevocable, sub-licensable through multiple levels of sublicensees, perpetual license to use, edit, digitize,
    modify, reproduce, distribute, and store the Writing to provide our service and to operate ScriptFlo. If you
    are accepted into the WOAccelerator program, you will enter into a separate licensing agreement and we may
    feature the Writing on our Site and in related marketing and promotional materials (both digital and print).
    <br>
    In addition to Writings, when you submit, post, or otherwise engage in direct communications with ScriptFlo
    (through the use of our Site, via a telephone call with a member of our team, via email, messaging platform, or
    otherwise) (i.e., send a “Communication”) you also grant us a license to modify, use, adapt, copy, and publish
    the Communication. You agree that this license includes the right for ScriptFlo to use the Communication for
    promotional purposes and to improve the Site.
    <br>
    <strong>Responsibility for User Content.</strong> You understand that you are solely responsible for any Writing
    or Communication sent to ScriptFlo. By uploading a Writing or sending a Communication to ScriptFlo, you
    represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to the Writing and that you’re not infringing or
    violating any third party’s rights by uploading the Writing, including, but not limited to, privacy rights,
    publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights. You agree that the Writing or
    Communication provided to ScriptFlo is non-confidential and that ScriptFlo has the right to unrestricted
    use for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.
    <br>
    <strong>Disclosure of Writing is Not Confidential.</strong> By uploading a Writing to ScriptFlo, you agree
    that ScriptFlo may discuss your Writing with its employees and authorized agents to evaluate the Writing and
    your acceptance into ScriptFlo programs. By submitting a Writing or applying to a ScriptFlo program, you
    acknowledge and agree that you are not creating a confidential relationship between you and ScriptFlo.
    <br>
    <strong>Submission of Writing is Not Returned.</strong> If you submit a Writing to ScriptFlo, you
    acknowledge and agree that ScriptFlo is not obligated to return the Writing to you. You should keep a copy
    of any Writing submitted. You further acknowledge and agree that ScriptFlo is not agreeing to provide you
    with any compensation for your Writing, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.

    remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available
    to a court or other tribunal. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE

    IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, THE PARTIES WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY A CLASS ACTION, CLASS
    ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
    <br>

    disturbance, pandemic, epidmic, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or
    Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe, or any
    other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
    any remaining provisions.
    <br>
    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    You agree that we may assign any of our rights and/or transfer, sub-contract, or delegate any of our obligations
    under these Terms. Your agreement to these Terms is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to any
    third party.

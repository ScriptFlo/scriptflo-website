    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome! The following privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) outlines the types of Personal Information (defined
        below) that WO Accelerator, Inc. (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects when operating services through our website
        https://woaccelerator.com, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices (the
        “Site” or “WO Accelerator”). If you use the Site on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then
        "you"
        includes you and that entity.
        <br>
        Before using WO Accelerator’s website or submitting any Personal Information to WO Accelerator, please review this
        Privacy Policy carefully and contact us at legal@woaccelerator.com if you have any questions. By using the Site,
        you
        agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do
        not
        access or use the Site.
    </p>

    <h3> How You Accept This Policy</h3>
    <p>
        When you visit WO Accelerator, apply to a WO Accelerator program, sign up for an account, or otherwise provide us
        with
        any Personal Information, you consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h3> What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
    <p>
        The information we collect from you falls into two categories: Personal Information (i.e., data that could
        potentially identify you as an individual) and non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that
        cannot be used to identify who you are) ("Non-Personal Information"). This Privacy Policy covers both types and
        will
        tell you how we might collect and use each type.
        <br>
        We may collect a variety of Personal Information, including:
        <br>
        Your first and last name, email address, phone number, age range, postal address, references, and education when
        you
        apply to a WO Accelerator program;
        Credit card information (although we use a third party payment processor, as described below), billing address,
        and
        shipping address; and
        Other information requested from Third Party Services (defined below) that you explicitly give us access to.
        <br>
        We may also collect a variety of Non-Personal Information, including:
        <br>
        Various analytics data including: (i) the IP address of the computer you use to access our Site; (ii) the type
        of
        browser software you are using; (iii) the operating system you are using; (iv) the date and time you access or
        use
        our Site; (v) the website address, if any, that linked you to our Site; (vi) the website address, if any, you
        travel
        to after leaving our website; and (vii) other non-personally identifiable traffic data; and
        Responses to various application questions.
        <br>
        <h3> How We Collect Information</h3>
        <h4>
            When You Provide Us With Information to Make a Payment </h4>
        <p> We, or companies that provide services on our behalf, may collect certain financial information from you,
            such as
            your payment method (this may include valid credit card number, type, expiration date, or other financial
            information). By making a payment through WO Accelerator, you give us consent to use and provide your
            financial
            information as we consider necessary to process the transaction.</p>
        <h4>
            Information We Automatically Collect </h4>
        <p> Like most websites, WO Accelerator incorporates technology such as "pixel tags," "web beacons," and
            "cookies." Pixel
            tags or web beacons are tracking devices on websites or in emails that can monitor the behavior of the user
            visiting
            the website or sending the email. Cookies (not to be confused with the sugary treat) are small files that
            web
            servers may place on your computer when you visit a website.
            <br>
            We use cookies to help identify and track usage of our Site and to make it easier to deliver a personalized
            experience. You can easily refuse our cookies by adjusting your preference in your browser. However, be
            forewarned
            that disabling cookies may cause WO Accelerator to not operate properly.
            <br>
            In order to improve and grow WO Accelerator, we also use analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to
            automatically
            collect information about user and visitor usage (collectively “Analytics Tools”). These Analytics Tools
            collect
            data such as how often you visit WO Accelerator, what areas of the Site you visit, and what other sites or
            services
            you used prior to using WO Accelerator.
            <br>
            Analytics Tools generally operate differently. For example, Google Analytics only collects the IP address
            assigned
            to you on the date you visit WO Accelerator, not your name or other identifying information. Although Google
            Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your computer to identify you as a unique user the next time you
            visit, the
            cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. As of right now, we only use the information we get from
            Analytics Tools
            to improve our Site and do not combine the information collected through the use of Analytics Tools with
            Personal
            Information. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future.
            <br>
            Please note Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your use of
            WO Accelerator is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can
            prevent
            Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to WO Accelerator by disabling cookies on your
            browser. You
            also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on here.
            <p>
                <h4> Third Party Services</h4>
                We haven’t built all of the features offered on WO Accelerator from scratch. To run WO Accelerator, we
                utilize various
                third-party products (collectively “Third Party Services”), such as third party payment processors. If
                you authorize
                us to connect with these Third Party Services, you grant us permission to collect certain Personal
                Information, such
                as your name, email address, and any other information that the Third Party Services make available to
                us. Please
                note that your use of these Third Party Services is governed by their respective Terms of Service and
                Privacy
                Policies. We use and disclose any collected information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

                <h4> Communications You Initiate with Us</h4>
                We do everything possible to make sure you have an amazing experience on our Site. If you contact us in
                person, by
                phone, email, or by some other means (either through our Site or through a Third Party Service), we may
                keep a
                record of your contact information and correspondence for later reference (to help improve our Site and
                service to
                you).

                <h3>How We Use the Information We Gather</h3>
                <p>
                    We primarily use the information we collect and store to enhance WO Accelerator. Except if we sell
                    all or a portion
                    of our business, or as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your Personal
                    Information.
                    <br>
                    <h4> Use to Provide Our Site to You</h4>
                    We use Personal Information to create an awesome experience. Some ways we may internally use your
                    information
                    include to:
                    <br>
                    Provide, maintain, administer, or expand WO Accelerator and deliver to you information that you
                    request;
                    Respond to correspondence that we may receive from you;
                    Perform business analyses or support, improve, or enhance WO Accelerator or other products and
                    services we offer;
                    Send you WO Accelerator-related information (through email or otherwise) such as updates, special
                    offers, and changes
                    to certain legal documents, or content that we think will interest you based on your preferences;
                    Contact you when necessary or requested;
                    Customize and tailor your WO Accelerator experience; or
                    Prevent, detect, and investigate security breaches or potentially illegal or prohibited activities.
                    <br>
                    Aggregated Personal Data and Non-Personal Information
                    We may share or disclose aggregated Personal Data or Non-Personal Information with service
                    providers, or with other
                    persons we conduct business with. These service providers and other persons may also share with us
                    aggregated
                    Non-Personal Information that they have independently developed or acquired. Additionally, we may
                    combine aggregate
                    information from the pixel tags, web beacons, and cookies with similar data we collect from other
                    visitors to help
                    us improve our Site. When doing so, we do our best to ensure that any aggregated information cannot
                    be linked back
                    to you.
                    <br>
                    Except as we discuss in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with third
                    parties who wish
                    to market other products and services to you.
                    <br>
                    <h4> Agents or Third-Party Partners</h4>
                    We may provide your Personal Information to our employees, contractors, agents, service providers,
                    and designees
                    ("Agents") to enable them to perform certain services for us exclusively, including:
                    <br>
                    <h4> Payment processing;</h4>
                    Website-related services such as web hosting;
                    Improvement of website-related services and features;
                    Maintenance services; or
                    Development of new services.
                    <br>
                    <h4> Business Transfers</h4>
                    We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is
                    typically one of the
                    business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out
                    of business,
                    enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, your Personal Information could be one
                    of the assets
                    transferred to or acquired by a third party. By accepting this Privacy Policy, as outlined above,
                    you consent to any
                    such transfer.
                    <br>
                    <h4> Protection of Us and Others</h4>
                    We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably
                    believe is necessary
                    to comply with law or court order; cooperate with law enforcement; enforce or apply our Terms of Use
                    and other
                    agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of WO Accelerator, our employees, our users,
                    or others.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Data Retention</h3>
                <p> WO Accelerator will retain your data for the life of our services. We may also retain some Personal
                    Information that
                    you have provided to us beyond the life of our services in order to maintain the Site for other
                    members or to comply
                    with relevant laws. That being said, if you would like your data deleted, please contact us at
                    legal@woaccelerator.com.
                </p>
                <h3> Security and Maintenance of Applications</h3>
                <p>
                    You submit applications at your own risk. We implement commercially reasonable technical,
                    administrative, and
                    organizational measures to protect Application Information both online and offline from loss,
                    misuse, and
                    unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail
                    transmission is ever
                    fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore,
                    you should take
                    special care in deciding what Application Information you send to us.
                    <br>
                    After the application process has ended, we may retain your application and the information
                    contained therein.
                </p>
                <h3> Children</h3>

                We are especially sensitive about children's information. We’re not a site targeted towards children
                and we don’t
                knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you have questions concerning
                our information
                practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 13 has used
                Wo Accelerator or
                provided us with Personal Information, please email us at legal@woaccelerator.com.

                <h3> Protection of Personal Information</h3>

                The security of the information you provide is extremely important to us. We employ several physical
                and electronic
                safeguards to keep your information safe, including encrypted user passwords and securing all
                connections with
                industry standard transport layer security.
                <br>
                If you have an account that you access on a shared computer, be sure to sign out of your account
                when finished. If
                you believe a third party has access to your account, you must let us know as soon as possible.
                <br>
                Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure,
                alteration, or deletion
                of data through events such as, but not limited to, hardware or software failure or unauthorized
                entry or use.
                <br>
                <h3> Online Tracking and How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h3>

                Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity used to deliver
                targeted
                advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer,
                Firefox, and Chrome)
                incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does
                not want to have
                his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular
                DNT signal, the
                service may refrain from collecting certain Personal Information about the browser’s user. Not all
                browsers offer a
                DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For
                these reasons, many
                website operators, including WO Accelerator, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more
                information about
                DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.
                <br>
                <h3> Changes to This Policy</h3>

                We may modify our Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be reflected on
                this page and
                will become effective immediately upon posting. If the changes are significant, we will do our best
                to notify you
                via email or through a notification. Please check the effective date below to determine if there
                have been any
                changes since you have last reviewed this Privacy Policy.
                <br>
                <h3> Your Rights as a California Resident</h3>

                Residents of California have the right to request from us certain information with respect to the
                types of Personal
                Information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes and the
                identities of the
                third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding
                calendar year. To
                exercise your rights, you may make one request each year by emailing us at legal@woaccelerator.com.
                Your request
                should specify your full name and the email address you used when submitting Personal Information to
                us.
                <br>
                If you are a California resident, you have the following rights:
                <br>
                Information. To request that we disclose the following information about our collection and use of
                your personal
                information during the past 12 months:

                The categories of personal information that we have collected about you;
                The categories of sources from which personal information is collected;
                The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information;
                The categories of third parties with whom we share your personal information;
                Whether we have disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, and if so, the
